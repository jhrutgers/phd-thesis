  abstract = {Multimedia applications process streams of values and can often be
	represented as task graphs. For performance reasons, these task graphs
	are executed on multiprocessor systems. Inter-task communication
	is performed via buffers, where the order in which values are written
	into a buffer can differ from the order in which they are read. Some
	existing approaches perform inter-task communication via ?rst-in-?rst-out
	buffers in combination with reordering tasks and require applications
	with affne index-expressions. In our previous work, we used circular
	buffers with a non-overlapping read and write window, such that a
	reordering task is not required. However, these windows can cause
	deadlock for cyclic task graphs. In this paper, we introduce circular
	buffers with multiple overlapping windows that do not delay the release
	of locations and therefore they do not introduce deadlock for cyclic
	task graphs. We show that buffers with multiple overlapping read
	and write windows are attractive, because they avoid that a buffer
	has to be selected from which a value has to be read or into which
	a value has to be written. This signi?cantly simpli?es the extraction
	of a task graph from a sequential application. These buffers are
	also attractive, because a buffer capacity equal to the array size
	is sufficient for deadlock-free execution, instead of performing
	global analysis to compute sufficient buffer capacities. Our case-study
	presents two applications that require these buffers.},

  title = {Automatic parallelization of nested loop programs for non-manifest
	real-time stream processing applications},
  school = {University of Twente},
  year = {2011},
  address = {Enschede, the Netherlands},
  month = jul,
  abstract = {This thesis is concerned with the automatic parallelization of real-time
	stream processing applications, such that they can be executed on
	embedded multiprocessor systems. Stream processing applications can
	be found in the video and channel decoding domain. These applications
	often have temporal requirements and can contain non-manifest conditions
	and expressions. For non-manifest conditions and expressions the
	results cannot be evaluated at compile time. Current parallelization
	approaches have difficulties with the extraction of function parallelism
	from stream processing applications. Some of these approaches require
	applications with manifest behavior and affine index-expressions.
	For these applications, they can derive data dependencies and insert
	inter-task communication via FIFO buffers. But, these approaches
	cannot support stream processing applications with non-manifest loops.
	Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge current approaches can
	only extract a temporal analysis model from applications with manifest
	behavior and without cyclic data dependencies. To address the issues
	mentioned above, we present an automatic parallelization approach
	to extract function parallelism from sequential descriptions of real-time
	stream processing applications. We introduce a language to describe
	stream processing applications. The key property of this language
	is that all dependencies can be derived at compile time. In our language
	we support non-manifest loops, if-statements, and index-expressions.
	We introduce a new buffer type that can always be used to replace
	the array communication. This buffer supports multiple reading and
	writing tasks. Because we can always derive the data dependencies
	and always replace the array communication by communication via a
	buffer, we can always extract the available function parallelism.
	Furthermore, our parallelization approach uses an underlying temporal
	analysis model, in which we capture the inter-task synchronization.
	With this analysis model, we can compute system settings and perform
	optimizations. Our parallelization approach is implemented in a multiprocessor
	compiler. We evaluated our approach, by extracting parallelism from
	a WLAN channel decoder application and a JPEG decoder application
	with our multiprocessor compiler.},

  abstract = {Research on Networks on Chips (NoCs) has spanned over a decade and
	its results are now visible in some products. Thus the seminal idea
	of using networking technology to address the chip-level interconnect
	problem has been shown to be correct. Moreover, as technology scales
	down in geometry and chips scale up in complexity, NoCs become the
	essential element to achieve the desired levels of performance and
	quality of service while curbing power consumption levels. Design
	and timing closure can only be achieved by a sophisticated set of
	tools that address NoC synthesis, optimization and validation.},

  abstract = {In a multiprocessor system-on-chip (MPSoC) private caches introduce
	the cache coherence problem. Here, we target at heterogeneous MPSoCs
	with a network-on-chip (NoC). Ex- isting hardware cache coherence
	protocols are less suitable for MPSoCs because many off-the-shelf
	processors used in MPSoCs do not support these protocols. Furthermore,
	these protocols typically rely on global visibility and serialization
	of writes which does not match well with the parallel point- to-point
	communication provided by a NoC. Therefore, we propose a software
	cache coherence protocol, which can be applied in a heterogeneous
	MPSoC with a NoC. The soft- ware cache coherence protocol relies
	on explicit synchroniza- tion in the software. More specifically,
	caches are guaran- teed to be coherent according to the Release Consistency
	model, on top of which we have implemented the standard Pthreads
	communication library. Heterogeneous MPSoCs with off-the-shelf processors
	can easily be supported, be- cause processors are only required to
	provide cache control operations, e.g., clean and invalidate. All
	cache coherence operations are interruptible and do not impact the
	execu- tion of tasks on other processors, therefore this protocol
	is suitable for predictable MPSoCs. Our software cache coher- ence
	protocol is implemented on an ARM926EJ-S MPSoC which is mapped on
	an FPGA. From experiments we con- clude that the protocol overhead
	is low for the applications taken from the SPLASH-2 benchmark set.
	For these appli- cations we observed a speedup between 1.89 and 2.01
	on the two processor MPSoC.},

  abstract = {{<p>The most exciting development in parallel computer architecture
	is the convergence of traditionally disparate approaches on a common
	machine structure. This book explains the forces behind this convergence
	of shared-memory, message-passing, data parallel, and data-driven
	computing architectures. It then examines the design issues that
	are critical to all parallel architecture across the full range of
	modern design, covering data access, communication performance, coordination
	of cooperative work, and correct implementation of useful semantics.
	It not only describes the hardware and software techniques for addressing
	each of these issues but also explores how these techniques interact
	in the same system. Examining architecture from an application-driven
	perspective, it provides comprehensive discussions of parallel programming
	for high performance and of workload-driven evaluation, based on
	understanding hardware-software interactions.<br><br>* synthesizes
	a decade of research and development for practicing engineers, graduate
	students, and researchers in parallel computer architecture, system
	software, and applications development<br><br>* presents in-depth
	application case studies from computer graphics, computational science
	and engineering, and data mining to demonstrate sound quantitative
	evaluation of design trade-offs <br><br>* describes the process of
	programming for performance, including both the architecture-independent
	and architecture-dependent aspects, with examples and case-studies<br><br>*
	illustrates bus-based and network-based parallel systems with case
	studies of more than a dozen important commercial designs}},
